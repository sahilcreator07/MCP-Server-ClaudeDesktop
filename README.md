 Just Built a Lead Scoring Assistant for Claude Using MCP! ðŸ¤–

Iâ€™ve just created an AI-powered Lead Scoring Assistant with MCP that helps you prioritize and score leads on the flyâ€”based on company size, budget, and intent. Now, scoring leads has never been easier or faster!

With this integration, I can now:

Automatically score and qualify leads as they come in based on key data points

View recent leads with a quick command, keeping my sales pipeline organized

Get instant AI insights to help prioritize the best leads to follow up with!

An example prompt could be: "Score the lead from Acme Industries, a manufacturing company with 5000 employees, a $100k budget, and an intent score of 90."
The system will instantly score the lead and tell me if itâ€™s a hot, warm, or cold leadâ€”saving valuable time!

With MCP, I can integrate all these tools, resources, and prompts seamlessly to make lead qualification smarter, faster, and more effective.

Letâ€™s make smarter business decisions together with AI! ðŸš€ðŸ’¼
